    <h2>Tech Experiences</h2>
    <P>There's only one experience I remember having with coding is on roblox in grade 7. 
        I used Lua scripting to make a game in roblox as my project.<br> It worked really well 
        and my only goal was to show that my game works and to frustrate my friends 
        by making the game as difficult as I can.</br> I am pretty sure I have had other 
        coding experiences but I donâ€™t remember them too well except the Lua scripting.</P>
