    <h2>About Website Owener</h2>
    <P>Hi! My name is Zahin Rahman. I am a student at T.L.Kennedy secondary school. <br>I took this course to
        understand how computer coding works and</br> so I can use it in the future when I need to. I love playing
        basketball. <br>It's how I take things off my mind. Always keep try to be up to date on the NBA. Time to time
    </br>I like playing video games, especially when it's with my friends. My favorite game is Breath of the
        wild.<br>The PC I am currently using is a PC I built by gathering up the parts and I try to upgrade it whenever
        possible.</br> It's really fun for me to tinker around with the computer parts. I also love to read about
        mythological creatures or basically any myths or stories.<br> I do like reading books and stuff. My favorite
        book is the Eragon (the movie sucks).</br> A movie I like is Deadpool. I liked the humor and everything about
        the movie.</P>
